# All challenges will be in digital mode But participants will have to change location for each task. which will be integrated in the answer for that round.



Storyline: "The Cybersecurity Quest"

Introduction: Participants are recruited as "Cyber Agents" to protect a virtual city called "Cyberia." 
The city is under threat from a notorious cybercriminal seeking to disrupt its systems. The participants' 
mission is to stop the cybercriminal's plans by navigating through challenges and collecting clues to prevent a cyber attack.



Challenge 1: "Ciphered Communication"

Scenario: The cybercriminal has encrypted critical messages between the city's security systems. Agents need to decrypt the 
messages to uncover vital clues.

Challenge: Participants receive a series of encrypted messages using basic ciphers (like Caesar cipher or substitution cipher). 
They're provided with clues to decode these messages, which contain hints about the cybercriminal's plan.


Challenge 2:


Challenge 3:


Challenge 4: "Cybersecurity Quiz"

Scenario: As agents progress through Cyberia, they encounter an encrypted message that hints at the cybercriminal's hideout. 
To decode the message, agents must prove their cybersecurity knowledge and navigate to the next location.

Challenge: Participants are presented with a series of Fill in the Blanks statements related to cybersecurity principles 
and VIT Bhopal. These statements cover basic cybersecurity practices and interesting facts about VIT Bhopal. Upon answering 
each question correctly, participants take the first letter of each answer to reveal a hidden location clue. This clue guides 
them to the next task location.


Challenge 5: "Digital Code Breaker"

Scenario: The cybercriminal plants hidden codes in Cyberia's systems. Agents need to decode these to uncover the cybercriminal's hideout.

Challenge: Participants are given a set of visual puzzles or pattern recognition tasks. They need to decode the patterns to reveal hidden 
messages or codes that lead them closer to the cybercriminal's location.


Finale:
Code Integration: At the final location, participants combine information gathered from all challenges to decipher a final message
To do that they take the result of all 5 challenges as Input and Design a code to get the final location.
logic for the code will be explained to the participants when the reach the final location which is the location for Prize distribution
